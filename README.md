This is a quick tool to display some of the information the OCZ Vertex exposes via Smart. Currently it shows the average wear count, and a percentage that indicates how many erase cycles the drive has left.

This code was forked from github user lgerbarg, it was originally called Vertex Watcher but i've turned it into a tray item. All licenses and copyrights left intact.
